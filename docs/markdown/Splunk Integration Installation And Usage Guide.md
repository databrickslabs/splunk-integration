# TOPOLOGY AND SETTING UP SPLUNK ENVIRONMENT
* This app can be set up in two ways:
    
    1. **Standalone Mode**:
        * Install the Databricks Add-on for Splunk.
    2. **Distributed Environment**:
        * Install the Databricks Add-on for Splunk on the search head and configure an account to use the custom commands.
        * In case of deployment in the search head cluster environment use a deployer to push the apps. Follow the below steps to push the apps to search head cluster members:
            * On deployer node, extract the app at $SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/shcluster/apps.
            * Create a `shclustering` stanza at path $SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/shcluster/apps/TA-Databricks/local/server.conf and add following information to the stanza: conf_replication_include.ta_databricks_settings = true as shown below.
                * `[shclustering]`
                * `conf_replication_include.ta_databricks_settings = true`
            * Push the bundle to search head members


# INSTALLATION
Databricks Add-on for Splunk can be installed through UI using "Manage Apps" > "Install app from file" or by extracting tarball directly into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ folder.

# CONFIGURATION
Users will be required to have admin_all_objects capability in order to configure Databricks Add-on for Splunk. This integration allows a user to configure only one pair of Databricks Instance, Databricks Access Token and Databricks Cluster Name at a time. In case a user is using the integration in search head cluster environment, configuration on all the search cluster nodes will be overwritten as and when a user changes some configuration on any one of the search head cluster members. Hence a user should configure the integration on only one of the search head cluster members. Once the installation is done successfully, follow the below steps to configure.

# CUSTOM COMMANDS:
Users will be required to have admin_all_objects or list_storage_passwords capability in order to execute the custom command. Once the user configures Databricks Add-on for Splunk successfully, they can execute custom commands. With custom commands, users can:

* Query their data present in the Databricks table from Splunk.
* Execute Databricks notebooks from Splunk.

Currently, Databricks Add-on for Splunk provides three custom commands. Users can open the Splunk search bar and can execute the commands. Below are the command details.

## 1. databricksquery
This custom command helps users to query their data present in the Databricks table from Splunk.

* Command Parameters

| Parameter       | Required | Overview                                                         |
